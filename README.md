Gender Classification on Video dataset using Deep Learning Models

Gender classification works by extracting frames from videos, preprocessing them, and feeding them into deep learning models like CNNs, RNNs, and other architectures. The models learn features from facial patterns and sequences to classify gender. Performance is evaluated using accuracy, loss metrics, and test predictions.

Features:
1. Video Frame Extraction – breaking videos into image frames.
2. Preprocessing – resizing, normalization, and cleaning frames.
3. Feature Extraction – CNNs capture facial features; RNN/LSTM models capture temporal patterns.
4. Model Training – multiple architectures (CNN, RNN, ResNet, VGG, etc.).
5. Evaluation – accuracy, loss, and predictions on test data.
